<h2 id="dave">dave</h2>

<pre><code>- globs on lock(),unlock(),steal(),options()?,move(),copy(),propfind(),proppatch() (and set/unset).
- rework ls to use globs.
- multistatus responses don&#39;t come through nicely.</code></pre>

<h2 id="HTTP::DAV">HTTP::DAV</h2>

<pre><code>- Rework the file transfer code to avoid slurping complete files in memory
  and read through a fixed size buffer, to avoid memory hogs or crashes
  when transferring huge files.
- LWP doesn&#39;t allow callback on upload, only download. This means
  we can&#39;t do progress indicators on &quot;PUT&quot;. How to do it? Could patch
  LWP? Specialise LWP::UserAgent? Ugh.
- doco globs in DAV.pm
- fix get references
- _put calls propfind on every call throughout a recursive _put().
  need to adjust this so that it does it only once, in put(). After 
  the first time, we should be able to KNOW whether it is a collection
  or not instead of having to propfind to find out becasue in theory
  WE were the ones who put the file there.

- finish &quot;source&quot; property in DAV::Resource.pm
- redo POD Resource.pm

- setup_if_headers need to get just Rsource&#39;s locks not all RL&#39;s locks.
- discovery still isn&#39;t resetting locks properly ????
- DAV.pm as_string needs working resource
- finish lock (bug against mod_dav somewhere)

- mod t/* for IIS 5 lock and proppatch deficiencies.
- how to we handle degradation for incomplete servers in test suite (IIS)?
- mod_dav has a very strange bug with lock-null resources.
  The following combination of commands makes it weird out:
     $ mkdir dir1
     $ lock dir1
     $ lock dir2 (this is a lock null)
     $ move dir1 dir2
     Now, the spec says that dir2 should now be the copy of dir1 and it should be locked.
     However, mod_dav has an unlocked dir2. Even worse, if you delete dir2, there is 
     a shadowed lock-null resource called dir2 sitting behind the scenes. Bad.</code></pre>

<h2 id="Wishlist-functions">Wishlist functions</h2>

<pre><code>- testing against Zope
- dave:implement netrc?
- dave:tab completion? history?
- dave:implement more advanced command-line interaction
- dave:copy/move should allow the user to set &#39;depth&#39; and &#39;overwrite&#39;
- redo auth as a callback? If so, needs 2 functions, get and success.</code></pre>

<h2 id="Wishlist-projects">Wishlist projects</h2>

<pre><code>- Namespaces are not currently supported. I munge around them since
  they are not supported in DOM1 which is what XML::DOM uses.
- Rework Response.pm now that LWP::Status supports the status codes.

- support for LWPng which is fully HTTP/1.1 compliant.
- DAV Bindings
- DAV Redirects Reference
- DAV Ordered collections
- DAV DASL support
- DAV Delta-V
- DAV ACL&#39;s</code></pre>
